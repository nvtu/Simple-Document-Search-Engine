In the West, water is power, and power is never relinquished without a struggle. For more than one hundred years water power has been wielded by irrigators, diverting and using water under state law. In 1986, the Wyoming State Legislature passed a law recognizing that leaving water in the stream for fisheries is a beneficial use. The struggle for water power has intensified ever since.
Dan Budd: "Water of the Green River is accountable for a fourth of the industrial tax base of the state of Wyoming, in Rock Springs, the power plants, the trona plants, the fertilizer plants . . . "
The settlement of Wyoming depended on consumptive use of water -- that means taking water out of the stream and putting it to work for irrigation, industrial or municipal use. In the past three decades a competing concept -- instream flow -- is shaping the debate over how water is used and who makes the decisions.
Laurie Goodman: "There is a growing instream flow movement throughout the West. And I think it's reflective of the evolving economies that are happening in the West right now and a change from sole dependence on agriculture and looking at other values that are now coming forward."

Patrick Tyrell: "The Wyoming instream flow statute passed in 1/1/1986 and it does define the instream flow and leaving the water instream as a beneficial use -- that it would be to maintain or enhance fisheries."
Senator Cale Case: "It was passed reluctantly by the Legislature because there was a citizens initiative that was going to take precedence if the Legislature didn't act."

Dan Budd: "I was involved in the Legislature when the instream flow laws were proposed and of course resisted them with all of my ability. You can't eat recreation, and you can't eat scenery."
Tom Annear: "If development comes to the Green River basin . . . we would at least have that safety net, called instream flow water right that would let you keep a little of that water in the stream."
