Saved, the brave baby who doctors have left for dead: Lily's parents refused to sign 'do not resuscitate' form even before she was born - but now she is 'absolutely fabulous'
-Lily's parents say they are delighted they didn't sign doctors' 'DNR' form 
-Medics said her chances of surviving without serious disability were slim 
-Argued that the most 'humane' thing to do would be to let her slip away
-But her parents refused - and she will leave hospital in a few weeks time 
This is Baby Lily – who has defied the odds to survive after coming into this world almost four months too early. But the tiny girl had an extra hurdle to overcome, her parents claim, because doctors decided before she was even born that they would not resuscitate her.The couple claim they were asked to sign a ‘do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’, known as a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), form. They refused. Lily’s father said: ‘Telling them to stick that form was the best thing we have ever done.’ The medics had argued the baby’s chances of surviving without serious disability were slim, and that the most ‘humane’ thing to do was to let her slip away, he said. They were ‘preparing to hand me my daughter in a box’, added her father. Distraught, he insisted they were transferred to another hospital, where Lily’s delivery was delayed by three vital days to help her develop in the womb. There she was born, weighing just 1lb 6oz. After more than three months in neo-natal care, she is now 4lb 8oz, feeding from a bottle, and should be home in a few weeks. Last night, her emotional father explained how he and his partner had fought doctors to give their daughter a chance of life. He said: ‘Never give up, that’s my motto.’ They went to Southend University Hospital in Essex on April 1, as Lily’s mother believed her waters had broken. She was at the start of her 24th week of pregnancy. ‘If we’d signed that form, I don’t believe Lily would be here today’, Lily's father. When they were asked to sign the DNR form, the father, who does not wish to be named, chased the consultant down a corridor and demanded a transfer to Homerton Hospital in East London.
He said: ‘I lost control of my words and emotions. I was offensive to him. But I had to get us out of there.’
By contrast, he said, doctors at the Homerton – which has a much bigger neo-natal unit - did everything they could to delay the birth and then keep Lily alive.
‘They fought every inch of the way and we are so grateful to them,’ he said. The 31-year-old father, who works in shipping, believes the Southend doctors should never have assumed Lily would die. He said: ‘It’s like playing cards. You can’t fold. You’ve got to play the next hand. ‘And we did, and Lily is here. If we’d signed that form, I don’t believe Lily would be here today.’ Lily’s mother said: ‘She is absolutely fabulous. She’s doing so well and is guzzling her bottles down.’  Cheryl Schwarz, Southend Hospital’s acting chief nurse, said an investigation had been launched. She said the hospital followed a 2008 ‘framework’ from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine on resuscitating extremely premature babies. This states that for those born at 23 weeks, ‘a professional experienced in resuscitation should be available to attend the birth’, but adds: ‘In the best interests of the baby a decision not to start resuscitation is an appropriate approach, particularly if the parents have expressed this wish.’ About 50 per cent of babies born in week 24 in British hospitals survive, according to a study based on 2006 data. Half the survivors have moderate or serious disabilities, but the rest are either healthy or have only minor problems.
