A 2-year-old girl died, and a grandmother and 4-year-old child were injured when a mail truck hit them as they tried to cross a New Jersey street Monday, authorities say.
The vehicle slammed into the pedestrians on Rahway Avenue in Elizabeth around 10 a.m., officials said. Witnesses said the grandmother was carrying the 2-year-old, who was tossed into the air by the impact.
When she looked back she saw the truck and turned but the baby flew up," said witness Andres Figueroa. "It's hard to see a baby like that."
Witnesses said the grandmother appeared unconscious, under the mail truck, at the scene; another driver stopped and ran out to help the older child as the mail carrier pulled the 2-year-old out of the road.  
The 2-year-old girl was initially taken to the hospital in critical condition; the toddler later died there. The 4-year-old child and the grandmother were also taken to a hospital; the extent of their injuries is unknown. 
Chopper 4 footage from the scene showed a United States Postal Service truck and a motorcycle cordoned off by caution tape. The USPS driver remained at the scene; witnesses said the driver had the right of way.
"It's a lot of traffic here," said witness Edgar Rubin Gomez. "A lot of people, they don't want to wait for the lights so they just cross."  
Kim Tansey said she travels in Elizabeth regularly and the intersection where the three people were hit "is a really bad intersection." She called the child's death "heartbreaking." 
A spokesman for USPS said the Postal Service is conducting a full investigation and cooperating with authorities.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in the tragic event today," spokesman George Flood said.
