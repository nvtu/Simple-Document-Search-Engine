Rafa Benítez starts life at Real Madrid with penalty defeat to Roma.
Rafa Benítez began his tenure as Real Madrid manager with a frustrating 7-6 shootout defeat to Roma in a pre-season friendly. With the match ending goalless in front of a crowd of 80,746 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the International Champions Cup match was decided by spot kicks and the former Barcelona player Seydou Keita slotted the winner after a miss by Lucas Vázquez.
Roma had the better first-half chances and were denied an opener after three minutes when Daniele De Rossi hit the crossbar with a right-footed shot from the centre of the box. Gareth Bale fired over the bar three minutes later before Sergio Ramos, wearing the captain’s armband after the recent departure of the long-serving goalkeeper Iker Casillas, also chipped over from a corner kick in the ninth minute.
Casillas’s replacement in goal, the Costa Rica international Keylor Navas, was forced to make a fine save in the 30th minute, leaping to his right to put a glove on a Salih Ucan volley after the Turkey player latched on to a corner kick from Totti at the far post.
Searching in vain for a first goal, Bale tried an audacious bicycle kick in the area after Ramos lobbed the ball in but the Welshman succeeded only in fouling Ashley Cole. Bale rose again for a header eight minutes after the break but his effort flashed just right of the near post from a Ramos corner and he came off soon after.
Karim Benzema, who replaced Cristiano Ronaldo at the break, then squandered a gilt-edged chance from the centre of the box after the hour-mark when his wild left-footed shot soared high and wide after a pinpoint cross from the Russian winger Denis Cheryshev.
The match ended in a flurry of shots, with Bale’s replacement Vázquez stepping inside a defender before being denied by a fine save from keeper Bogdan Lobont.
