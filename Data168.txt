“Two decades ago ours was the only solar system known to astronomy that had planets. Today we have found thousands of alien worlds … that’s an incredible advance in our knowledge of how common our home, the Earth, actually is,” Dr Duffy said.

It was an event as big as Galileo first staring through a telescope to see the moons of Jupiter. We just don’t fully appreciate it yet.

In 1992, scientists found the first confirmed planets outside our own solar system. They were dead worlds, sterilised by the X-rays spewed out by the crushed remains of their star (a pulsar).

1995 clinched it: A planet was found orbiting the Sun-like star 51 Pegasi. But it also came with some big surprises. The planet was 150 times larger than Earth, but it was so close to its parent star that its orbit took a mere 4.2 days.

That wasn’t supposed to be possible. Now, we’ve found many more like it.

In fact, most of the solar systems we’ve found look nothing like our own. Only recently have we found one with a “twin Jupiter” sitting protectively in a similar orbit.

Most of the exoplanets found so far are huge titans like Jupiter and Saturn. Many are far too close to their stars – zipping around in orbits that count years in terms of days and hours. They’re commonly called “Hot Jupiters”

But we’ve found plenty others. Some are prime candidates for life.

“Every star in the night sky is likely to have a planet,” Dr Duffy said. “Around every fifth star will be an Earth-sized world lying in a region hospitable for life.”

“This is the grail of modern astronomy,” SETI’s Dr Marchis said. “We’re trying desperately now to image those planets because we know they exist.”
