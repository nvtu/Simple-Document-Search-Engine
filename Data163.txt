The top line: If we are actively involved in trying to reach a goal, or an activity that is challenging but well suited to our skills, we experience a joyful state that is called "flow." 
The experience of flow in both professional and leisure activities leads to increased positive affect, performance, and commitment to long-term, meaningful goals.

Do you ever find yourself so completely immersed in what you're doing that you lose track of time?
All of a sudden you look up at the clock and realize that hours have passed and you missed dinner time?
Think a minute about this. When does this loss of time and total engagement typically occur for you? 
This could apply to a martial artist completely absorbed in perfecting a flying kick, or a violinist fiercely concentrating on a complex symphony. 
One may find still greater happiness working towards long-term, meaningful goals. 
Viktor Frankl, who survived a Nazi concentration camp, once said "What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him." (Frankl, 1992)

This loss of self-consciousness that happens when you are completely absorbed in an activity - intellectual, professional, or physical - is described in contemporary psychology as a state of flow.
In order for a flow state to occur, you must see the activity as voluntary, enjoyable (intrinsically motivating), and it must require skill and be challenging (but not too challenging) with clear goals towards success.
You must feel as though you have control and receive immediate feedback with room for growth.
Interestingly, a flow state is characterized by the absence of emotion - a complete loss of self-consciousness -however, in retrospect, the flow activity may be described as enjoyable and even exhilarating!
