Sunderland sign Kaboul from Tottenham

Sunderland have completed the signing of Younes Kaboul from Tottenham.

The 29-year-old defender and former Spurs club captain has signed a four-year contract with the Black Cats, having fallen from favour under Mauricio Pochettino last season.

Kaboul becomes Sunderland's fourth signing of the summer after the arrivals of Dynamo Kyiv forward Jeremain Lens and fellow defenders Adam Matthews and Sebastian Coates.

“I’m delighted to be a Sunderland player and it’s an honour to join this club,” Kaboul told Sunderland's official website.

“I would like to thank Lee Congerton and the head coach for making this move possible and I can’t wait to start playing for the Sunderland supporters.”

Dick Advocaat added: "He is a very experienced player, which is what we need. He has shown that in his time at Spurs and he will be a very good addition to our squad."
