Townsend stars on bizarre licence plate publication cover.

The Tottenham winger appears to have a passion for cars and has now partnered with Regtransfers magazine, bizarrely taking to the front cover along with his prized Porsche.

Andros Townsend is currently preparing for the 2014-15 Premier League season with Tottenham, but he has revealed what may be his true passion in life: a personalised number plate!

The winger - who made 35 appearances in all competitions last term - bizarrely appeared on the front cover of this month’s Regtransfers magazine, a free issue that is dedicated to “the world of personal number plates”, proudly showing off his own, which reads “AND 2OS”.

Townsend has a chequered history with his cars, and crashed a white Porsche, worth £100,000, in 2013, though he appears to have stuck by his previous choices, with his licence plate adorning a brand new iteration of the car.

There have been some rather strange footballing endorsements in recent times, but Townsend’s partnership with Regtransfers has to be one of the oddest to date.
