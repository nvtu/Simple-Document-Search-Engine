Education is one of the holiest occupations in my view. I disagree with that
teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Although
teachers are important for students, the most important part for learning
knowledge is students themselves.
Different teachers has different style, so it is hard to evaluate how well each
teacher teaches according to how much students learn. As nobody would have
the same character, teachers also have their own teaching styles such as
humorous, gentle, strict, to name a few. Maybe some students like humorous
teachers, while others prefer a gentle one. But probably the students of a strict
teacher could give good results in their study, even though these teachers teach
the same thing. We could not say that the strict teacher should be paid higher
than the gentle teacher, since we know that the students have learned more
because they were afraid.
On the other hand, how much or how well students learn depends on students
themselves. In a school, it is easy to see that some students are with high marks,
while some others have lower marks. A teacher is a person who direct students
how to learn. Students should do much more works. The more attention
students pay, the more knowledge they learn. The hard-workers probably get
higher scores. Students' learning results depend on individual students'
intellectual abilities and the time and energy that they put into learning.
Sometimes it has nothing to do what how well the teachers taught. In addition,
knowledge that students learn not only comes from the teachers, but also from
many sources. Family influence, extracurricular reading and out-class teaching
are some of the sources that can provide students with knowledge.
In sum, although teachers are important in students' education and learning,
there are many other factors that decide how well students' learn. So it is unfair
that teachers are paid according to how much their students learn.
