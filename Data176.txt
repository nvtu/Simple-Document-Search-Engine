Lloris suffers fractured wrist during Tottenham training

The 28-year-old could now miss Spurs' season opener against Manchester United on August 8, while Michel Vorm is set to deputise

Tottenham have confirmed that Hugo Lloris has suffered a fractured wrist during pre-season training.

The 28-year-old is now a doubt for Spurs' Premier League season opener away to Manchester United on August 8.

Lloris has been linked with a move to United as a replacement for David De Gea, who is closing in on a move to Real Madrid.

“The France goalkeeper will continue to work alongside the First Team squad to build up his fitness in a bid to be ready for the start of the season,” read a statement from Tottenham.

“Our medical team will continue to monitor his rehabilitation and progress during pre-season.”

Michel Vorm, who joined from Swansea City last July, will deputise in the France international's absence.
