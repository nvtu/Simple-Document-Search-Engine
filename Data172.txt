Like a scene from the Wizard of Oz, Brian Morganti's spectacular shots show real-life wind funnels, stovepipes, truncated cones and elephant trunks
A fearless storm chaser has captured magnificent scenes as an astonishing number of tornadoes ripped through Colorado in just 24 minutes.
Brian Morganti was only hoping to find a supercell or two to chase - but instead he managed to chase down 14 twisters.
Like a scene from the Wizard of Oz, his spectacular shots show real-life wind funnels, stovepipes, truncated cones and elephant trunks.
The impressive pictures give a glimpse of how close Brian was to the tornadoes, displaying amazing detail of the dust clouds they produced.
The sheer scale of the tornado ripping through the skies is clearly visible against the strong greenery of the grass.
Brian said: "I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw a large dark dust swirl about a quarter mile behind me - and had to get out to photograph the action once again."
"This was when a high base tornado funnel occurred at cloud level with a long skinny needle tornado extended to the ground occasionally producing dark dust swirls," he continued.
"Marble size hail began to fall and the tornado was getting away from me to the south. So time to blast south again."
To get these incredible shots, Brian drove roughly 375 miles.
In 19 years, and more than 600 days of chasing, it was one of the most prolific days he had experienced
